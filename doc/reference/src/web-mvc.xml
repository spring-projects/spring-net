    <title>Introduction to Spring.NET ASP.NET MVC Infrastructure</title>

    <para>The Spring.NET for ASP.NET MVC Infrastructure increases your
    productivity when you write ASP.NET MVC 2.0 applications by making the
    full power of the Spring.NET framework available to your MVC
    projects.</para>

    <para>Highlights of the Spring.NET for ASP.NET MVC Infrastructure (also
    referred to in this document as Spring.Web.Mvc) are:</para>

        <para>Dependency Injection of Controllers and ActionFilters. <!--GLOBAL: In pdf, these links are not highlighted in any way, so the reader does not know to click on them. Can we fix this?-->ASP.NET
        MVC 2.0 provides two primary extensbility points for Dependency
        Injection: <literal>Controllers</literal> and
        <literal>ActionFilters</literal>. Spring.Web.Mvc makes it extremely
        simple to inject dependencies into either your MVC
        <literal>Controllers</literal> or <literal>ActionFilters</literal>.
        Simply register your <literal>Controllers</literal> and
        <literal>ActionFilters</literal> with the context using any one of the
        typical object definition approaches supported by Spring.NET and the
        Spring.Web.Mvc infrastructure will ensure these objects are assembled
        correctly when the ASP.NET MVC run-time has need of them.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="web-mvc-objectscope">Web object scopes</link>.
        Just as with the Spring.NET Web Infrastructure for ASP.NET Webforms,
        Spring.Web.Mvc objects can be defined at the application, session, or
        request scope. This capability makes it easy to inject, for example, a
        session scoped shopping cart, into your controllers without any lower
        level programming.</para>

    <para>The Spring.NET distribution ships with a Web.Mvc Quick Start
    application. The Web.Mvc QuickStart is the best way to see how to
    integrate Spring.Web.Mvc into your own ASP.NET MVC applications.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="web-mvc-configuration">
      <title>Configuration of a ASP.NET MVC Application</title>

      <para>Spring.Web.Mvc builds on top of the Spring.NET IoC container.
      <literal>Controllers</literal> and <literal>ActionFilters</literal> that
      make up a typical Spring.Web.Mvc-enabled application are configured with
      the same standard Spring.NET XML configuration syntax used for non web
      objects. To integrate with the ASP.NET MVC runtime you need to make a
      few modifications to your <literal>Web.config</literal> file and your
      <literal>Global.asax</literal>.</para>

      <para>The instantiation and configuration of the Spring.NET IoC
      container by the Spring.Web.Mvc infrastructure is wholly transparent to
      application developers, who typically never have to explicitly
      instantiate and configure an IoC container manually (by, for example,
      using the <literal>new</literal> operator in C#). To effect the
      transparent bootstrapping of the IoC container, you need to modify the
      primary <literal>Application</literal> class in the
      <literal>Global.asax</literal> so as to derive it from the special
      <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class as shown in the following
      snippet:</para>

      <programlisting language="csharp">    public class MvcApplication : SpringMvcApplication
    {
        
    }
</programlisting>

      <para>Note that the <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class is
      abstract so that developers may only use it indirectly as a superclass
      of their own global application class in the
      <literal>Global.asax</literal> of their ASP.NET MVC applications.</para>

      <para>After the <literal>Global.asax</literal> is modified as indicated
      above, you also need to define a root application context by adding a
      Spring.NET configuration section to your <literal>Web.config</literal>
      file. The final configuration file should resemble the following; your
      exact configuration may vary in particulars and the following snippet
      illustrates only the Spring-specfic entries and excludes the remainder
      of the content (typically) required by ASP.NET MVC.</para>

      <programlisting language="myxml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;

    &lt;configSections&gt;
        &lt;sectionGroup name="spring"&gt;
          &lt;section name="context" type="Spring.Context.Support.MvcContextHandler, Spring.Web.Mvc"/&gt;
        &lt;/sectionGroup&gt;
    &lt;/configSections&gt;

    &lt;spring&gt;
        &lt;context&gt;
            &lt;resource uri="~/Config/Controllers.xml"/&gt;
            &lt;resource uri="~/Config/Filters.xml"/&gt;
            &lt;resource uri="~/Config/Production/Services.xml"/&gt;
            &lt;resource uri="~/Config/Production/Dao.xml"/&gt;
        &lt;/context&gt;
    &lt;/spring&gt;

&lt;/configuration&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>Notes about the preceding configuration:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Define a custom configuration section handler for the
          <literal>&lt;context</literal><code>&gt;</code> element. If you use
          Spring.NET for many applications on the same web server, it might be
          easier to move the whole definition of the Spring.NET section group
          to your <literal>machine.config</literal> file.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The custom configuration section handler is of the type
          <literal>Spring.Context.Support.MvcContextHandler</literal> which in
          turn instantiates an IoC container of the type
          <literal>Spring.Context.Support.MvcApplicationContext</literal>.
          This ensures that all features provided by Spring.Web.Mvc, such as
          request and session-scoped object definitions, are handled
          properly.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Within the <code>&lt;spring&gt;</code> element, define a root
          context element. Next, specify resource locations that contain the
          object definitions that are used within the web application (such as
          service or business tier objects) as child elements within the
          <classname>&lt;context&gt;</classname> element. Object definition
          resources can be fully-qualified paths or URLs, or non-qualified, as
          in the example above. Non-qualified resources are loaded using the
          default resource type for the context, which for the
          <literal>MvcApplicationContext</literal> is the
          <literal>WebResource</literal> type.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The object definition resources do not have to be the same
          resource type (for example, all <literal>file://</literal>, all
          <literal>http://</literal>, all <literal>assembly://</literal>, and
          so on). This means that you can load some object definitions from
          resources embedded directly within application assemblies
          (<literal>assembly://</literal>) while continuing to load other
          object definitions from web resources that can be more easily
          edited.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Customizing the Behavior of the ASP.NET MVC Application
      Class</title>

      <para>The default behavior, settings, ASP.NET MVC start-up related and
      Spring.NET container-configuration behaviors can be modified and
      controlled by overriding various methods of the
      <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> in your own derived instance.
      The following section describes these overridable methods and their
      existing behavior provided in the base
      <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class. Please note that if you
      choose to override any of these methods and do not subsequently invoke
      the base <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class' implementation
      of that same method, then you are completely responsible for ensuring
      that the underlying reponsibilities of that method in the base class are
      satisfied by your overloaded implementation. Without either ensuring
      this or invoking the base class implementation within your overridden
      method, the underlying behavior of the ASP.NET MVC runtime (and its
      integration with Spring.NET) is unlikley to function as intended.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="mvc-application-start-method">
        <title>Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)</title>

        <para>This method is provided by the Microsoft base
        <literal>HttpApplication</literal> class and is overridden in the
        <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> base class to be responsible
        for invoking the <link
        linkend="mvc-register-routes-method"><literal>RegisterRoutes()</literal></link>
        and <link
        linkend="mvc-register-areas-method"><literal>RegisterAreas()</literal></link>
        methods. If you choose to override the
        <literal>Application_Start()</literal> implementation of the
        <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class in your own
        implementation, ensure that you either call
        <literal>base.Application_Start()</literal> or explicitly invoke both
        the <literal><link
        linkend="mvc-register-routes-method">RegisterRoutes()</link></literal>
        and <link
        linkend="mvc-register-areas-method"><literal>RegisterAreas()</literal></link>
        methods within your within your override of this method.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="mvc-configure-application-context-method">
        <title>ConfigureApplicationContext()</title>

        <para>This method is invoked by the
        <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class after it has been
        configured with all of its object definitions and other settings (as
        detailed in <link linkend="web-mvc-configuration">Configuration of a
        ASP.NET MVC Application)</link> but immediately prior to its being
        handed off to the ASP.NET MVC infrastructure for its use. Overridding
        this method provides you with your last possible moment to make any
        additional modifications to the <literal>IApplicationContext</literal>
        before it is put into service for the ASP.NET MVC framework's use. In
        the <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> base class, this method is
        a no-op and thus does nothing. It exists only to provide an
        extensibility point for developers wishing to interact with the
        <literal>IApplicationContext</literal> at this point in the
        application startup/context configuration lifecycle.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="mvc-register-spring-controller-factory-method">
        <title>RegisterSpringControllerFactory()</title>

        <para>This method is responsible for registering the
        <literal>SpringControllerFactory</literal> with the ASP.NET MVC
        framework, in effect telling ASP.NET MVC "please use the
        <literal>SpringControllerFactory</literal> to create
        <literal>Controllers</literal>." This is the manner in which the
        Spring.NET container is subsequently invoked to satisfy dependencies
        on <literal>Controllers</literal> when they are instantiated by
        ASP.NET MVC in response to an Http Request. Generally, there should be
        little need for the developer to override this method, but if you do
        you must ensure that your either invoke the base implementation of
        <literal>RegisterSpringControllerFactory()</literal> from within your
        implementation or that you explicitly register the
        <literal>SpringControllerFactory</literal> with the ASP.NET MVC
        infrastructure yourself from witihin this method (or elsewhere at the
        appropriate time).</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="mvc-register-routes-method">
        <title>RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)</title>

        <para>This method is responsible for registering ASP.NET MVC Routes
        during application startup and is automatically invoked from within
        the <link
        linkend="mvc-application-start-method"><literal>Application_Start()</literal></link>
        method in the <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> base class. The
        provided implementation of this method in the
        <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class merely registers the
        same <literal>Default</literal> route as is present in any new ASP.NET
        MVC project that Visual Studio creates (e.g.,
        "<literal>{controller}/{action}/{id}</literal>"). As such it is
        expected that most developers will override this method and provide
        their own implementation wherein they will register their own routes.
        Unless you desire to retain the out-of-the-box
        <literal>Default</literal> routing configuration of
        "<literal>{controller}/{action}/{id}</literal>" it is not necessary
        for developers to call the <literal>RegisterRoutes() </literal>method
        of the <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> base class from within
        their own overrides of this method.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="mvc-register-areas-method">
        <title>RegisterAreas()</title>

        <para>This method is responsible for registering ASP.NET MVC Areas
        during application startup and is automatically invoked from within
        the <link
        linkend="mvc-application-start-method"><literal>Application_Start()</literal></link>
        method in the <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> base class. The
        provided implementation of this method in the
        <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> class merely invokes
        <literal>AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas()</literal> in the ASP.NET
        MVC framework. As such, it is not common to have to override this
        method as provided in the <literal>SpringMvcApplication</literal> base
        class unless you desire more fine-grained control over registering
        areas. If you choose to override this method in your own derived
        class, you are assuming the responsibility of registering all Areas
        with the ASP.NET MVC runtime.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="web-mvc-objectscope">
    <title>Web object scopes</title>

    <para>Spring.NET web applications support an additional attribute within
    object definition elements that allows you to control the scope of an
    object: <programlisting language="myxml">&lt;object id="myObject" type="MyType, MyAssembly" scope="application | session | request"/&gt;</programlisting>Possible
    values for the scope attribute are <classname>application</classname>,
    <classname>session,</classname> and <code>request</code>. Application
    scope is the default, and is used for all objects with an undefined scope
    attribute. This scope creates a single instance of an object for the
    duration of the IIS application, so that the objects works exactly like
    the standard singleton objects in non-web applications. Session scope
    defines objects so that an instance is created for each HttpSession. This
    scope is ideal for objects such as user profile, shopping cart, and so on
    that you want bound to a single user.</para>

    <para>Request scope creates one instance per HTTP request. Unlike calls to
    prototype objects, calls to
    <literal>IApplicationContext.GetObject</literal> return the same instance
    of the request-scoped object during a single HTTP request. This allows
    you, for example, to inject the same request-scoped object into multiple
    pages and then use server-side transfer to move from one page to another.
    As all the pages are executed within the single HTTP request in this case,
    they share the same instance of the injected object.</para>

    <para>Objects can only reference other objects that are in the same or
    broader scope. This means that application-scoped objects can only
    reference other application-scoped objects, session-scoped objects can
    reference both session and application-scoped objects, and request-scoped
    objects can reference other request-, session-, or application-scoped
    objects. Also, prototype objects (including all ASP.NET web pages defined
    within Spring.NET context) can reference singleton objects from any scope,
    as well as other prototype objects.</para>
