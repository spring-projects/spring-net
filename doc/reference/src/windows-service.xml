    <title>Remarks</title>
    <para>
    This is functionality that will be included after the 
    1.0 release.  If you want to use these features please get the 
    code from CVS <ulink url="https://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/NET/Project+Structure"></ulink>
    (instructions) or from the download section of the Spring.NET website that contains an
    .zip with the full CVS tree.
    In addition to this documentation
    you can refer to the example program located at
    <literal>examples\Spring\Spring.Examples.WindowsService</literal>
    to better understand the package.  Please check the Spring.NET 
    <ulink url="https://www.springframework.net/doc/reference/windows-service.html">website</ulink> 
    for the latest updates to this document.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
    Developers usually create Windows Services using the 
    Visual Studio .NET wizard.  While not difficult to do, this
    procedure is repetative and does not encourage separation between 
    infrastructure code (windows service) and application code.  This is
    generally considered a "bad thing" but you can certainly disagree.
    </para>
    <para>    
    As Spring.NET can provide an explicitly managed
    initialize/destroy lifecycle for singleton objects, there is
    a natural synergy with the lifecycle of a Windows service.
    As such, it could be very convenient to expose a Spring application 
    context as a Windows service. Starting and stopping the service corresponds
    to creating and destroying an application context and its
    contained objects.  This approach provides a high level means to
    declare what objects are created and destroyed when developing
    a Windows service. 
    </para>
    <para>
    To do that, Spring.NET requires the installation of one physical 
    service able to run as services as many applications as you want - each a 
    logical independent service in their own application domain.  
    By default, the deployment and updating of the service can also
    be done by copying the relevant executables to a special directory.
    </para>
    <para>
    The executable that at present provides these features is the
    <literal>Spring.Services.WindowsService.Process.exe</literal>
    assembly. It makes heavy use of classes and interfaces definde in 
    the <literal>Spring.Services.WindowsService.Common.dll</literal>
    assembly.  You should reference the common assembly it if you want to 
    follow the advice on customization contained in the following sections 
    </para>
    <para>
    The benefits of this approach, a part from those given by separating
    infrastructure code and application code (a field where Spring.NET
    tries hard to succeed) is that you can think about installing a new 
    service at client site by simply dropping a new application assembly
    in a remote directory<footnote></footnote>.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>The <literal>Spring.Services.WindowsService.Process.exe</literal> application</title>
    <sect2>
      <title>Installing</title>
    <para>
    The installation can be done in two ways, using the .NET SDK
    <literal>installutil.exe</literal> tool or using the more mundane
    <literal>Spring.Services.WindowsService.Installer.exe</literal>;
    while the former is the standard, the latter is probably  
    more flexible. It allows you to customize the name/display name of the 
    service and has the ability to install multiple times the same assembly
    with different names.  This can be useful in a 
    number of scenarios, especially where you don't like, for some 
    reasons, to run several different logical services under the 
    same physical windows service.
    </para>
    <para><emphasis>
    Be aware of the fact that the service will be installed as
    running with the system account (installing with a specific
    user account seems a bit buggy on Windows XP)
    </emphasis></para>
    <para>
    That said, while <literal>installutil</literal> 
    <ulink url="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cptools/html/cpconinstallerutilityinstallutilexe.asp">
    <citetitle>is documented on its own </citetitle></ulink>, 
    the command line for 
    <literal>Spring.Services.WindowsService.Installer.exe</literal>
    is as follow:    
      <programlisting>Spring.Services.WindowsService.Installer.exe

usage: 
 install service-exe-path service-display-name service-name
 uninstall service-name      [i|u] service-exe-path service-display-name service-name</programlisting>
      for example, to install, you can invoke it with the following:
      <programlisting>... install  Spring.Services.WindowsService.Process.exe "Spring.Service Support" spring-service</programlisting>
      and to uninstall it: 
      <programlisting>... uninstall  spring-service</programlisting>
    </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>
    The standard .NET <literal>.config</literal> file 
    can be used to tune some parameters of 
    <literal>Spring.Services.WindowsService.Process.exe</literal>, 
    (including log4net settings, for which it is recomended to consult 
    the log4net documentation).
    </para>

    This file also define the context run by this process; here the file in its current beauty:

    <para>
    As you see, the context is defined in another file: let's review the objects it defines.
    </para>
    <para>
    Firstly, it is worth notice that in order to 'localize' the service (i.e. to know where it is installed to use that directory as
    base for the deploy dir as in the above file) you should define an object like this: the name is not 
    very important, it is important that it is an <literal>IObjectFactoryPostProcessor</literal> and so will be 
    automatically applied to this application context:
