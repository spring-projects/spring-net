    <para>Spring provides an expression language that allows for the easy setting 
    or getting of an object's properties and the invoking of its methods.  
    The simple syntax of this expression language allows one to to easily express the
    properties or methods to invoke 
    in order to retrieve or set a value on an object.  For example to
    get the name property of an object, the required expression to
    evaluate this is simply "Name". The chaining of properties is also supported... 
    for example, if a person object contains a date of birth property (DOB) 
    that returns a <literal>DateTime</literal>, the year may be retrieved with
    the expression "DOB.Year".  This generic reflection-like functionality 
    has many uses but is often found as the foundation to support 
    a data binding language between GUI elements and model 
    objects.  As such, the data binding support for ASP.NET web pages
    contained in the <literal>Spring.Web</literal> library uses this expression language.

    Consider the simple class shown below with the 
    public field <literal>Name</literal><programlisting language="csharp">
public class Inventor
{
    public string Name;
    private DateTime dob;

    public DateTime DOB
    {
      get { return dob; }
      set { dob = value; }
    }
}
</programlisting>
    which may have been instantiated in code somewhere and had its Name
    and DOB set to particular values<programlisting language="csharp">Inventor inventor = new Inventor();
inventor.Name = "Nikola Tesla";
inventor.DOB = new DateTime(1854, 10, 9);
</programlisting>
    The <literal>ObjectNavigator</literal> is the central
    class used to set or retrieve the value of an object, and contains
    the following static methods
<programlisting language="csharp">
object GetValue(object root, string expression)
object GetValue(object root, NavigationExpression expression)

void SetValue(object root, string expression, object newValue)
void SetValue(object root, NavigationExpression expression, object newValue)
</programlisting>
    To retrieve the name and year of birth we can use the following code<programlisting language="csharp">
string name = (string) ObjectNavigator.GetValue(inventor, "Name");    
int year = (int) ObjectNavigator.GetValue(inventor, "DOB.Year");
    </programlisting>
    The string "DOB.Year" is used to create a 
    <literal>NavigationExpression</literal> object that forms the basis 
    for the parsing of the string.  If you need to
    evaluate a complex expression frequently, creating a 
    <literal>NavigationExpression</literal>
    and reusing it will increase performance.  To set the property values of this
    object instance to that of another famous inventor we would write<programlisting language="csharp">
ObjectNavigator.SetValue(inventor, "Name", "Michael Pupin");
ObjectNavigator.SetValue(inventor, "DOB", new DateTime(1854, 10, 9));
    </programlisting>
