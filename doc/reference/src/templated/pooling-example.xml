    <title>Pooling example</title>
    <para>
    The idea is to build an executor backed by a pool of 
    <literal>QueuedExecutor</literal>: this will show how Spring.NET 
    provides some useful low-level/high-quality reusable threading and 
    pooling abstractions.
    This executor will provide parallel executions (in our case 
    <literal>grep</literal>-like file scans).  <emphasis>Note: This example
    is not in the 1.0.0 release to its use of classes in the Spring.Threading
    namespace scheduled for release in Spring 1.1. To access ths example 
    please get the code from CVS <ulink url="http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/NET/Project+Structure">(instructions)</ulink> or from the download section of the 
    Spring.NET website that contains an .zip with the full CVS tree.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
    Some information on <literal>QueuedExecutor</literal> is helpful to 
    better understand the implementation and to possibly disagree with it.
    Keep in mind that the point is to show how to develop your own 
    object-pool.
    </para>
    <para>
    A <literal>QueuedExecutor</literal> is an executor where 
    <literal>IRunnable</literal> instances are run serialy by a worker 
    thread. When you <literal>Execute</literal> with a 
    <literal>QueuedExecutor</literal>, your request is queued; at some 
    point in the future your request will be taken and executed by the 
    worker thread: in case of error the thread is terminated. 
    However
    this executor recreates its worker thread as needed.
    </para>
    <para>Last but not least, this executor can be shut down in 
    a few different ways (please refer to the Spring.NET SDK documentation).    
    Given its simplicity, it is very powerful.
    </para>
    <para>
    The example project <literal>Spring.Examples.Pool</literal> provides 
    an implementation of a pooled executor, backed by n instances of 
    <literal>Spring.Threading.QueuedExecutor</literal>: please ignore 
    the fact that <literal>Spring.Threading</literal> includes already a
    very different implementation of a <literal>PooledExecutor</literal>:
    here we wanto to use a pool of <literal>QueuedExecutor</literal>s.
    </para>
    <para>
    This executor will be used to implement a parallel 
    recursive <literal>grep</literal>-like console executable.
    </para>
    <sect2>
    <title>Implementing <literal>Spring.Pool.IPoolableObjectFactory</literal></title>
    <para>
    In order to use the <literal>SimplePool</literal> implementation,
    the first thing to do is to implement the <literal>IPoolableObjectFactory</literal>
    interface. This interface is intended to be implemented by objects 
    that can create the type of objects that should be pooled.
    The <literal>SimplePool</literal>
    will call the lifecycle methods on <literal>IPoolableObjectFactory</literal> interface
    (<literal>MakeObject, ActivateObject, ValidateObject, PassivateObject, and DestroyObject</literal>)
    as appropriate when the pool is created, objects are borrowed and returned to the pool, and when
    the pool is destroyed.
    </para>    
    <para>
    In our case, as already said, we want to to implement a pool 
    of <literal>QueuedExecutor</literal>. Ok, here the declaration:   
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "factory-declaration") %>
    the first task a factory should do is to create objects:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "make") %>
    and should be also able to destroy them:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "destroy") %>
    </para>
    <para>
    When an object is taken from the pool, to satisfy a client request,
    may be the object should be activated. We can possibly implement the
    activation like this:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "activate") %>
    even if a <literal>QueuedExecutor</literal> restarts itself as 
    needed and so a valid implementation could leave this method empty.
    </para>
    <para>
    After activation, and before the pooled object can be succesfully 
    returned to the client, it is validated (should the object be 
    invalid, it will be discarded: this can lead to an empty unusable
    pool
    <footnote>
    <para>You may think that we can provide a smarter 
    implementation and you are probably right. However, it is not so 
    difficult to create a new pool in case the old one became unusable.
    It could not be your preferred choice but surely it leverages 
    simplicity and object immutability
    </para>
    </footnote>).
    Here we check that the worker thread exists:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "validate") %>
    </para>
    <para>
    Passivation, symmetrical to activation, is the process a pooled 
    object is subject to when the object is returned to the pool. In our 
    case we simply do nothing:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "passivate") %>
    </para>
    <para>
    At this point, creating a pool is simply a matter of creating an 
    <literal>SimplePool</literal> as in:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "create-pool") %>
    </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
    <title>Being smart using pooled objects</title>
    <para>
    Taking advantage of the <literal>using</literal> keyword seems
    to be very important in these <literal>c#</literal> days, so we 
    implement a very simple helper (<literal>PooledObjectHolder</literal>)
    that can allow us to do things like:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "execute") %>
    without worrying about obtaining and returning an object from/to the 
    pool.
    </para>
    <para>
    Here is the implementation:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "holder") %>
    </para>
    <para>
    Please don't forget to destroy all the pooled istances once you have 
    finished! How? Well using something like this in 
    <literal>PooledQueuedExecutor</literal>:
    <%= PoolExample("PooledQueuedExecutor.cs", "stop") %>
    </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
    <title>Using the executor to do a parallel <literal>grep</literal></title>
    <para>
    The use of the just built executor is quite straigtforward but a 
    little tricky if we want to really exploit the pool.
    <%= PoolExample("Grep.cs", "parallel-grep-class") %>
    </para>
    <para>    
    <%= PoolExample("Grep.cs", "parallel-grep-main") %>
    </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
