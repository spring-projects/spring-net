The examples directory in the distribution contain the following examples.

[Movie Finder](/doc-latest/reference/html/quickstarts.html): A simple demonstration of Dependency Injection (DI) techniques using Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) container.

[Application Context](/doc-latest/reference/html/quickstarts.html): Demonstrates IoC container features such as localization, accessing of ResourceSet objects, and applying resources to object properties.

[Aspect Oriented Programming](/doc-latest/reference/html/aop-quickstart.html): Demonstrates use of the AOP framework to add additional behavior to your existing object. Examples of programmatic and declarative AOP configuration are shown.

[Distributed Computing](/doc-latest/reference/html/remoting-quickstart.html): A calculator demonstrating remote service abstractions that let you 'export' a plain .NET object (PONO) via .NET Remoting, Web Services, or an EnterpriseService ServiceComponent. Corresponding client side proxies are also demonstrated.

[WCF](/doc-latest/reference/html/wcf-quickstart.html): A calculator demonstrating dependency injection and applying AOIP advice to WCF services.

[Web Application - Spring Air](/doc-latest/reference/html/springair.html): A ticket booking application that demonstrates the ASP.NET framework showing features such as DI for ASP.NET pages, data binding, validation and localization.
