# Modules Downloads and Documentation

The Quartz Scheduling and Apache Active MQ module projects are now part of the Spring.NET 1.2 release.

The TIBCO EMS messaging support has been made part of the Spring.NET 1.3 release.

Modules are now developed under [Spring Extensions](http://www.springsource.org/extensions/); a new venture by SpringSource to encourage and support quality community contributed extensions to the Spring projects and programming model.

Spring Extensions hosts three .NET projects led by members of the Spring.NET community

[Spring db40 for .NET](http://www.springsource.org/extensions/se-db4o-net)

The purpose of this extension is to allow users of the popular db4o object database on the .NET platform to make use of Spring's powerful data access features, just like they can already do using ADO and NHibernate.

Lead: Dirk Lowers

[Spring Integration for .NET](http://www.springsource.org/extensions/se-springintegration-net)

Spring Integration for .NET provides an extension of the Spring programming model to support the well-known Enterprise Integration Patterns while building on the Spring Framework's existing support for enterprise integration. It enables simple messaging within Spring-based applications and integrates with external systems via simple adapters. Those adapters provide a higher-level of abstraction over Spring's support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling. Spring Integration's primary goal is to provide a simple model for building enterprise integration solutions while maintaining the separation of concerns that is essential for producing maintainable, testable code.

The Spring Integration for .NET project will use the design and code base of the [Spring Integration for Java](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration) project as a basis, adapting the code as need to support .NET idioms and move in the direction to take advantage of .NET only features such as Lambda expressions and extension methods.

Lead: Andreas DÃ¶hring

[Spring Threading](http://www.springsource.org/extensions/se-threading-net)

This project is based on a .NET port of the JSR-166 Java library for concurrency. We're making every attempt the bring the library over as-is while making it easy to use for both .NET developers and Java developers coming to .NET.
