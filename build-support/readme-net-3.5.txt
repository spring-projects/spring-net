Spring.NET 1.3.2 supports .NET 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0

To use Spring.NET with .NET 3.5 use the assemblies in the bin\net\3.5\debug or bin\net\3.5\release directory.  

All other Spring DLLs should be taken from the directory bin\net\2.0\debug.

The Assemblies in the bin\net\3.5 directory are built against Spring DLLs in the corresponding bin\net\2.0 directory.
