## 7. How to build

VS.NET
------

Visual Studio 2019 is required to open and build the solution. The free community version of Visual Studio should suffice.

## 8. Support

The user forums at http://forum.springframework.net/ are available for you to submit questions, support requests, and interact with other Spring.NET users.

Bug and issue tracking can be found at https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPRNET

A Fisheye repository browser is located at https://fisheye.springframework.org/browse/spring-net

To get the sources, fork us on github at https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-net

We are always happy to receive your feedback on the forums. If you think you found a bug, have an improvement suggestion or feature request, please submit a ticket in JIRA (see link above).

A word on bug reports: If at all possible, try to download one of the nightly snapshots at http://www.springframework.net/downloads/nightly/ and see, if this bug has already been fixed. If the problem still persists, don't forget to mention the version of Spring.NET you are using (check the file versions of Spring.NET dlls), the .NET version you are running on and a description how to reproduce the problem.
Ideally attach some sample code reproducing the problem to the JIRA ticket.
