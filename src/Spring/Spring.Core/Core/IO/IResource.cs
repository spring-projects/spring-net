	/// <summary>
    /// The central abstraction for Spring.NET's access to resources such as
    /// <see cref="System.IO.Stream"/>s.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>
	/// This interface encapsulates a resource descriptor that abstracts away
	/// from the underlying type of resource; possible resource types include
	/// files, memory streams, and databases (this list is not exhaustive).
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// A <see cref="System.IO.Stream"/> can definitely be opened and accessed
	/// for every such resource; if the resource exists in a physical form (for
	/// example, the resource is not an in-memory stream or one that has been
	/// extracted from an assembly or ZIP file), a <see cref="System.Uri"/> or
	/// <see cref="System.IO.FileInfo"/> can also be accessed. The actual
	/// behavior is implementation-specific.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// This interface, when used in tandem with the
	/// <see cref="IResourceLoader"/> interface, forms the backbone of
	/// Spring.NET's resource handling. Third party extensions or libraries
	/// that want to integrate external resources with Spring.NET's IoC
	/// container are encouraged expose such resources via this abstraction.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// Interfaces cannot obviously mandate implementation, but derived classes
	/// are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to expose a constructor that takes a
	/// single <see cref="System.String"/> as it's sole argument (see example).
	/// Exposing such a constructor will make your custom
	/// <see cref="Spring.Core.IO.IResource"/> implementation integrate nicely
	/// with the <see cref="Spring.Core.IO.ConfigurableResourceLoader"/> class.
	/// </p>
