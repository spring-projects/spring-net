	/// <summary>
	/// A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>
	/// Besides basic <see cref="ICollection"/> operations,
	/// queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection
	/// operations.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws
	/// an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special
	/// value (either <see lang="null"/> or <see lang="false"/>, depending on the
	/// operation). The latter form of the insert operation is designed
	/// specifically for use with capacity-restricted <see cref="IQueue"/>
	/// implementations; in most implementations, insert operations cannot
	/// fail.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a
	/// FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. Among the exceptions are
	/// priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied
	/// comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or
	/// stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).
	/// Whatever the ordering used, the head of the queue is that
	/// element which would be removed by a call to
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Remove"/> or
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Poll"/>. In a FIFO queue, all new
	/// elements are inserted at the tail of the queue. Other kinds of queues may
	/// use different placement rules. Every <see cref="IQueue"/> implementation
	/// must specify its ordering properties.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// The <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Offer(object)"/> method inserts an
	/// element if possible, otherwise returning <see lang="false"/>. This differs from the
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Add(object)"/> method, which can fail to
	/// add an element only by throwing an exception. The
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Offer(object)"/> method is designed for
	/// use when failure is a normal, rather than exceptional occurrence, for example,
	/// in fixed-capacity (or "bounded" queues.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// The <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Remove()"/>
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Poll()"/> methods remove and
	/// return the head of the queue. Exactly which element is removed from the
	/// queue is a function of the queue's ordering policy, which differs from
	/// implementation to implementation. The
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Remove()"/> and
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Poll()"/> methods differ only in their
	/// behavior when the queue is empty: the
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Remove()"/> method throws an exception,
	/// while the <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Poll()"/> method returns
	/// <see lang="null"/>.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// The <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Element()"/> and
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Peek()"/> methods return, but do
	/// not remove, the head of the queue.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// The <see cref="IQueue"/> interface does not define the blocking queue
	/// methods, which are common in concurrent programming.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// <see cref="IQueue"/> implementations generally do not allow insertion
	/// of <see lang="null"/> elements, although some implementations, such as
	/// a linked list, do not prohibit the insertion of <see lang="null"/>.
	/// Even in the implementations that permit it, <see lang="null"/> should
	/// not be inserted into a <see cref="IQueue"/>, as <see lang="null"/> is also
	/// used as a special return value by the
	/// <see cref="Spring.Collections.IQueue.Poll()"/> method to
	/// indicate that the queue contains no elements.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// <see cref="IQueue"/> implementations generally do not define
	/// element-based versions of methods <see cref="System.Object.Equals(object)"/>
	/// and <see cref="System.Object.GetHashCode()"/>, but instead inherit the
	/// identity based versions from the class object, because element-based equality
	/// is not always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different
	/// ordering properties.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// Based on the back port of JCP JSR-166.
