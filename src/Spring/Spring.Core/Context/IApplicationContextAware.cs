/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>
/// Implementing this interface makes sense when an object requires access
/// to a set of collaborating objects. Note that configuration via object
/// references is preferable to implementing this interface just for object
/// lookup purposes.
/// </p>
/// <p>
/// This interface can also be implemented if an object needs access to
/// file resources, i.e. wants to call
/// <see cref="Spring.Core.IO.IResourceLoader.GetResource"/>, or access to
/// the <see cref="Spring.Context.IMessageSource"/>. However, it is
/// preferable to implement the more specific
/// <see cref="Spring.Context.IResourceLoaderAware"/>
/// interface to receive a reference to the
/// <see cref="Spring.Context.IMessageSource"/> object in that scenario.
/// </p>
/// <p>
/// Note that <see cref="Spring.Core.IO.IResource"/> dependencies can also
/// be exposed as object properties of the
/// <see cref="Spring.Core.IO.IResource"/> type, populated via strings with
/// automatic type conversion performed by an object factory. This obviates
/// the need for implementing any callback interface just for the purpose
/// of accessing a specific file resource.
/// </p>
/// <p>
/// <see cref="Spring.Context.Support.ApplicationObjectSupport"/>
/// is a convenience implementation of this interface for your
/// application objects.
