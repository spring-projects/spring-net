/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>
/// An implementation of the
/// <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IInitializingObject.AfterPropertiesSet()"/>
/// method might perform some additional custom initialization (over and above that
/// performed by the constructor), or merely check that all mandatory properties
/// have been set (this last example is a very typical use case of this interface).
/// </p>
/// <note>
/// The use of the
/// <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IInitializingObject"/> interface
/// by non-Spring.NET framework code can be avoided (and is generally
/// discouraged). The Spring.NET container provides support for a generic
/// initialization method given to the object definition in the object
/// configuration store (be it XML, or a database, etc). This requires
/// slightly more configuration (one attribute-value pair in the case of
/// XML configuration), but removes any dependency on Spring.NET from the
/// class definition.
