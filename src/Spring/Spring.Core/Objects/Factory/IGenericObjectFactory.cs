/// <summary>
/// Interface defining a factory which can return an object instance
/// (possibly shared or independent) when invoked.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface is typically used to encapsulate a generic factory
/// which returns a new instance (prototype) on each invocation.
/// It is similar to the <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IFactoryObject"/>, but
/// implementations of the aforementioned interface are normally meant to be defined
/// as instances by the user in an <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IObjectFactory"/>,
/// while implementations of this class are normally meant to be fed as a property to
/// other objects; as such, the
/// <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IGenericObjectFactory.GetObject"/> method
/// has different exception handling behavior.
/// </remarks>
