	/// <summary>
	/// Extension of the <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IObjectFactory"/> interface
	/// to be implemented by object factories that can enumerate all their object instances,
	/// rather than attempting object lookup by name one by one as requested by clients.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>
	/// <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IObjectFactory"/> implementations that preload
	/// all their objects (for example, DOM-based XML factories) may implement this
	/// interface. This interface is discussed in
	/// "Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development", by Rod Johnson.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// If this is an <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IHierarchicalObjectFactory"/>,
	/// the return values will not take any
	/// <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IObjectFactory"/> hierarchy into account, but
	/// will relate only to the objects defined in the current factory.
	/// Use the <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.ObjectFactoryUtils"/> helper class to
	/// get all objects.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// With the exception of
	/// <see cref="Spring.Objects.Factory.IListableObjectFactory.ObjectDefinitionCount"/>,
	/// the methods and properties in this interface are not designed for frequent
	/// invocation. Implementations may be slow.
