/// <summary>
/// Generic callback interface for code that operates on a
/// IDbCommand.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The return type from executing the
/// callback</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Allows you to execute any number of operations
/// on a single IDbCommand, for example a single ExecuteScalar
/// call or repeated execute calls with varying parameters.
/// </p>
/// <p>Used internally by AdoTemplate, but also useful for
/// application code.  Note that the passed in IDbCommand
/// has been created by the framework and will have its
/// Connection property set and the Transaction property
/// set based on the transaction context.</p>
/// <p>As an alternative to using this interface you can use
/// the delegate version which is particularly nice when using
/// anonymous delegates for writing more terse code and having
/// easy access to the variables in the calling class.</p>
/// <p>See <see cref="ICommandCallback"/> for a version that has the
/// base class DbCommand as the callback argument.</p>
/// </remarks>
