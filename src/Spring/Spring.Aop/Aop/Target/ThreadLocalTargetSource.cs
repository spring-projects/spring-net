	/// Alternative to an object pool.

	/// <p>
	/// Application code is written as to a normal pool; callers can't assume
	/// they will be dealing with the same instance in invocations in different
	/// threads. However, state can be relied on during the operations of a
	/// single thread: for example, if one caller makes repeated calls on the
	/// AOP proxy.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// This class act both as an introduction and as an interceptor, so it
	/// should be added twice, once as an introduction and once as an
	/// interceptor.
