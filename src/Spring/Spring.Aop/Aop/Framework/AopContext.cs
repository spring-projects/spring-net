	/// <summary>
	/// This class contains various <see langword="static"/> methods used to
	/// obtain information about the current AOP invocation.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>
	/// The <see langword="static"/>
	/// <see cref="Spring.Aop.Framework.AopContext.CurrentProxy"/> property is
	/// usable if the AOP framework is configured to expose the current proxy
	/// (not the default)... it returns the AOP proxy in use. Target objects or
	/// advice can use this to make advised calls. They can also use it to find
	/// advice configuration.
	/// </p>
    /// <p>
    /// To expose the current proxy, set the <see cref="Spring.Aop.Framework.ProxyConfig.ExposeProxy"/>
    /// property on the controlling proxy to <see langword="true"/>.
    /// The default value for the <see cref="Spring.Aop.Framework.ProxyConfig.ExposeProxy"/> property
    /// is <see langword="false"/>, for performance reasons.
    /// </p>
    /// <note>
	/// The AOP framework does not expose proxies by default, as there is a
	/// performance cost in doing so.
	/// </note>
    /// <p>
	/// The functionality in this class might be used by a target object that
	/// needed access to resources on the invocation. However, this approach
	/// should not be used when there is a reasonable alternative, as it makes
	/// application code dependent on usage under AOP and the Spring.NET AOP
	/// framework.
	/// </p>
