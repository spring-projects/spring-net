/// <p>
/// There are no methods on this interface, as methods are discovered and
/// invoked via reflection. Please do see read the API documentation for the
/// <see cref="Spring.Aop.Framework.Adapter.ThrowsAdviceInterceptor"/> class;
/// said documention describes in detail the signature of the methods that
/// implementations of the <see cref="Spring.Aop.IThrowsAdvice"/> interface
/// must adhere to in the specific case of Spring.NET's implementation of
/// throws advice.
/// </p>
/// <p>
/// There are any number of possible uses for this type of advice. Some
/// examples would include the ubiquitous logging of any such exceptions,
/// monitoring the number and type of exceptions and sending emails to
/// a support desk once certain criteria have been met, wrapping generic
/// exceptions such as System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException in
/// exceptions that are more meaningful to your business logic, etc.
