/// <remarks>
/// <p>
/// <i>Before</i> advice is advice that executes before a joinpoint, but
/// which does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding to
/// the joinpoint (unless it throws an <see cref="System.Exception"/>).
/// </p>
/// <p>
/// Spring.NET only supports <i>method</i> before advice. Although this
/// is unlikely to change, this API is designed to allow <i>field</i>
/// before advice in future if desired.
