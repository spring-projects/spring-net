/// Represents a generic interceptor.

/// <remarks>
/// <p>
/// A generic interceptor can intercept runtime events that occur within a
/// base program. Those events are materialized by (reified in) joinpoints.
/// Runtime joinpoints can be invocations, field access, exceptions, etc.
/// </p>
/// <p>
/// This interface is not used directly. Use the various derived interfaces
/// to intercept specific events.
